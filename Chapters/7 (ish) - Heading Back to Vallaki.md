The part is heading back to [[Vallaki]] and ran into [[Strahd]]. He fireballed us.

We barely survived. We continued onto Vallaki and the guard said "we're not celebrating tonight". He didn't have much else to give us.

He did mention there was an issue with the Burgomeister. Apparently he's sad and needs "happiness". 

[[Rictavio]] is coming back.
