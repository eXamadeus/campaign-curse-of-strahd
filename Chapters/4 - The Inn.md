The party headed towards the [[Blue Water Inn]].

---
- There are ravens all over the inn.
	- This was one of the signs [[Madam Eva]] told us about.
- [[Sprocket]] and [[Aran]] were able to feed some of the Ravens
- The "leader" raven took off into the city after "talking" with the other ravens
	- [[Lil' BR-UT-3]] followed it and eventually, they returned
	- The raven dropped a key in [[Aran]]'s hand
- The party went into the inn after deciding, "the ravens are kinda special, huh?"
	- There's a bartender, [[Danica]], who tells us about [[Baron (Vallakovich)|the burgomeister]]
	- Two men are in the inn, and a woman enters behind and seems to be "watching us"
		- The men are [[Karl Watcher]] and [[Nikolai Watcher]] the "Watcher Brothers"
		- The men tried to purchase [[Cersei]] and [[Ireena Kolyana]]
		- [[Aran]] tried to "sell them" but just wanted to get the money before knocking them out and running away
		- [[Cersei]] don't want none of that
		- The watchers decide they might want to make a deal, we oblige, and they buy us drinks
		- Who was that woman? They say she's an order of the ravens
	- The men leave
	- Lightning cracks and it begins pouring rain
		- [[Danica]] says, "Oh they aren't going to have the lighting now"
		- Bells start ringing, and the barkeep says "that's where the town learns of the fate of the festival"
		- The party sends [[Ismark Kolyanovich]] off to check out the bell meeting
- The party decides fuck it, and goes to bed
	- [[Aran]] realizes the key the raven dropped off looks a lot like the one for the room
	- [[Sprocket]] finds the room the key goes to
	- [[Aran]] finds a book in the sheets. The notes say:
		- The city is cruel and "they" (the authors) want to do something about it
		- Going to meet with the [[The Ravens|"Keepers of the Feather"]]
		- Wereraven
		- [[Brom]] and [[Bray]] are going to show me a secret
		- Note about the [[Mardakovs]] who run the [[Blue Water Inn]] who are friends of the "Keepers"
- The party heads back upstairs for the night
- Cersei has the highest body count
- [[Aran]] left with [[Tabitha]]
- Morning comes and the gang eats breakfast
	- Eggs, meat, and porridge
- [[Nora|The girl]] that was punished for disrupting the festival came to see us
	- Told us her friend, [[Arabelle]], went missing and a man named [[Bluto]] is the chief suspect
	- She gave us back [[The Keys]] and told us which one unlocks the jail
