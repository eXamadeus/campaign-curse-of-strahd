We find out that [[Rictavio]] has a carnival wagon in the warehouse district. We decide to investigate, since it sounds like one of [[Madam Eva]]'s prophecies.

Yaleena and Gunther Arasak are cleaning the area. We lied to Yaeleena and told her we were there to pick some stuff up for [[Rictavio]]. She believed us.

There was a tiger, named [[Valthrexenbob]], in the caravan. He apparently hunts evil Vistani. He's our buddy now.

He took us to a toy shop [[Blinksy Toys]] and there was a monkey named [[Piccolo]] that was his friend. The monkey gave us a clue that we can go back to the Caravan, as we missed something.
