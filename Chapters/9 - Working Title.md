[[Aran]] and [[Tabitha]] decided to get married. [[Celeste]] took the Sun Blade.

Once we awake in the morning, someone comes asking for the group of adventurers that ransacked their wagon. It turns out to be [[Rictavio]].

Rictavio gives us his life story, and tells us he's been working really hard to kill Strahd. He's been studying him for years. He can't win in a direct fight, so he's waiting for the right moment to strike.

Strahd hibernates in his coffin, sometimes for days, sometimes for years. Whenever Strahd is awake, it's nighttime. Whenever he rests, the sun comes out (slightly). Rictavio is a member of the [[The Ravens|Keepers of the Feather]].

He believes we can kill Strahd, where he can't. He tells us to find his protege, [[Esmerelda D'Avenir]]. She came to Barovia before him, but he hasn't found her yet. He wants us to find her, and tell her that he is well.

He thinks she will assist us, if we find her. He wanted his stuff back. We gave him back the:
- The prayer book

Apparently, Esmerelda has a ring of mind shielding, which might be pretty useful against Strahd.

We went to the Van Richtens tower in the middle of Lake Bartok. We ran into a lightning trap AND woke up a Young Blue Dragon.

It's kicking our ass.
