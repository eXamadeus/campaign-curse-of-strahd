The party set out to find [[Bluto]] and [[Arabelle]].

---
- [[Bluto]] is fishing in the middle of the lake (in a trance)
	- He throws [[Arabelle]] in a burlap sack into the water
	- We rescue [[Arabelle]] 
	- [[Sprocket]] ties a rock around [[Bluto]] and buries him at sea
- We return to [[Blue Water Inn|the inn]] and look for [[Nora]]
	- She apparently went to [[Watcherhaus]] with [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]]
	- [[Arabelle]] wants to return to her permanent [[Vistani]] camp in [[Vallaki]]
- Took Arabelle home, turns out they're kinda evil, accidentally crapped on [[Madam Eva]]
