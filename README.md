# Curse of Strahd
Mark's Curse of Strahd campaign notes.

This is an [obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) project. Please use that note-taking app so the project integrity is maintained.

---

The chapters start with [[1 - Night Hag Encounter]]. This was not the beginning of the story, but it was when I switched over to taking notes with this app. Everything since then should be included.

## What the folders mean

1. `Chapters/` is where story arcs go. Think of this as the "main" branch. Everything should relate to these. Name them like so `# - Chapter Description` with `#` being the chapter number. Chapters can span multiple sessions.
2. `Characters/`: The player characters, like [[Sprocket]].
3. `Gods/`: any gods you meet along the way, like [[Sel√ªne]].
4. `Images/`: this is where we host actual images that are embedded in other documents.
5. `Organizations/`: This is for things like the [[The Ravens|Ravens]] and the [[Vistani]].
6. `People/`: These are NPCs you meet along the way. They are sorted into folders matching the location where you first meet them.
7. `Places/`: This is broken down into places you have visited. They are broken down by city, or if there is no city then `Places/Barovia/` is where it goes.
8. `Things/`: This is for special items, stuff that doesn't fit elsewhere, etc.
