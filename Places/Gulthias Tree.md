Located on "Yester Hill" this is a large "evil looking" tree located on possibly some ancient graves.

- A raven told us:
	- It's very ugly and has red sap similar to blood
	- A ring of boulders surrounds the hill, which might be a druid circle
	- Encircling layers of cairns dot the hillside
	- There was a weird effigy statue in the center inside the ring of boulders
- Once we arrived, we noticed bramble creatures guarding the tree on the south side of the hill.
	- [[Karadin]] took an axe from the tree
	- There was a corpse near the axe [[Aran]] inspected and came to the conclusion that the dead man was trying to chop down the tree.
	- [[Sprocket]] and the others prepared for combat when [[Karadin]] took a swing at the tree with his axe, and all hell broke loose.
