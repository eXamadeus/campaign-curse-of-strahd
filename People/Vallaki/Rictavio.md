The man we killed at Lake Zarovich. He seems to be related to one of [[Madam Eva]]'s prophecies. He was the owner of [[Valthrexenbob]] and the Sun Blade.

Apparently, his name was Rudolph Van Richten, a famous author, scholar, and a doctor. Darkhon is his homeland. He married his childhood sweetheart Ingrid. Together they had a son named Erasmus, who was stolen away by the Vistani.

By the time Van Richten found his son, it was too late. His son was already a vampire spawn. It broke his heart. He then put his son to rest by slaying him.

Ingrid was killed in revenge by the Vistani man who stole his son.
